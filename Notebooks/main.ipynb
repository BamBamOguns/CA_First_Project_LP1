    "Ideas, creativity, and execution are essential for a start-up to flourish. But are they enough? Investors provide start-ups and other entrepreneurial ventures with the capital popularly known as \"funding\"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. In this project, my intention is to analyse funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. The data for each year of funding were gotten from 2 separate csv files (2018 and 2019) and from a database for years 2020 and 2021. In these files, the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, the investors' and other relevant information were provided."
